                <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
                <p class="justify">The aim of this project is to create a web-based database application that will serve as a movie rental system. This system will be an online platform that will offer its users various numbers of movies to rent, watch, review and more. It will consist of two types of main users: customers and employees. Users will be able to rent the movies that are already registered to the system. They will be given the opportunity to search for a specific movie by entering its title, director, genre, etc. The feature of rating and reviewing movies will help other users during the process of choosing movies whereas the feature of recommending movies to added friends will guarantee an enjoyable time while using this system. Customers will have the chance to demand for the movies that the system lacks and employees will be able to add the requested movies to the system. Employees will also be able to delete the accounts of desired customers from the system. Overall, the purpose of this movie rental system is to facilitate renting and watching movies online by using the optimal database design. In this report, this movie rental system is evaluated in terms of its functional requirements, non-functional requirements and limitations along with the explanation for the reasons behind using a database and the ER Diagram of the system.
                </p>
                <h3>2. Why/How A Database Is Going To Be Used As A Part Of The System</h3>
                <p class="justify">A <strong>database-management system (DBMS)</strong> is a collection of interrelated data and a set of programs to access that data [1]. As described above, our application consists of a system that lets users access a large collection of movies. In order to keep track of these data about movies and user information, and provide a smooth rental experience to users, we need an appropriate database management system. This system we are planning to design will store all the information about movies available to rent, requested movies, ratings and reviews, rental records, registered users’ account information and many more. Tables and the relationships established between these tables in our database schema will pave the way for a simpler design, therefore a more efficient application. The system will be used as a tool to allow the users to access and manipulate this data under the limitations described below in this report.</p>
